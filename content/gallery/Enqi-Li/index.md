My name is Enqi. I was a Chinese international student finishing the second year of Bachelor of Agricultural Science when I started this internship. I took this opportunity seriously and endeavoured to develop my personal and professional skills with the assistance of memebers in the biometry hub. At the end of this internship, the supervisors were pleased with my proformence and I was recommended to apply an Honour's degree in biometry. With a boost in confidence and the encouragement of my supervisor, I was more dedicated than ever and was able to achieve first class at the completion of my Honour's degree, which contrubuted me to become a research officer in SARDI as my first step in my professional career outside of the University. This internship has contributed me tremendously not only in study, but in life!

**EMPLOYMENT HISTORY**
- Research assistant in the biometry hub (The University of Adelaide). 5/08/2019 – 30/08/2019
  - Based on the previous studying experience, I have designed a field sampling application and a data analysis application for agricultural scientist in a precision agriculture project to collect, storage, analysis the data efficiently.

- Research officer in SARDI (South Australian Research and Development Institute), Primary industries and regions SA, Government of South Australia。 02/09/2019 – 30/06/2020
  - This job contributed to the development of IDM strategies for diseases of importance on the Lower Eyre Peninsula, and enhanced the agronomy/pathology capacity for the Southern Region by developing the skills and knowledge of the Regional Research Agronomist, including experience in conducting field research, analysing and interpreting data and reporting on project findings.

- Graduate Agronomist in Asian Vegetable Farm. 01/07/2020 – ongoing
  - This job provides an opportunity to apply my previous plant research and development knowledge and skills to the hydroponics and greenhouse production system on a real farm production business. It also enriches my view of Australian agricultural industries. This vegetable farm is one of the largest Asian vegetable hydroponic and greenhouse farms in South Australia.
  - As a production agronomist, my roles include
    - Learning and understanding crop life cycle, pests and diseases.
    - Monitoring biotic and abiotic stresses on vegetable crop (such as water stresses,
disease and pest) and solving the problem as soon as possible.
    - Collecting and testing soil, water and plant sample, and recording the data
    - Planning seedling time and number to match the market demand
    - Design of new hydroponic and substrate greenhouse
    - Pesticide application management (such as herbicide rotation, optimum spray
concentration, spraying tools adjustment, reducing herbicide damage on vegetable
and minimising herbicide drift in the farm)

**Past Projects**
- Sclerotinia disease in canola
  - A canola trial was sown before my appointment. Both the trial site and farmers paddocks will be monitored for the presence of sclerotinia and data collected will be supplement the earlier findings of Blake Gontar to develop IDM models for the control of sclerotinia on LEP. 

- Eyespot disease in wheat
  - An initial training session with Dr Evans was conducted in mid-October. Under the guidance of Dr Marg Evans, I learned how to identify eyespot disease and score its severity. He also conducted paddock surveys on the LEP and provided isolates to Dr Evans to contribute to knowledge of the incidence and population structure of eyespot in the Southern Region. 

- Pulse Agronomy and NVT
  - As part of the training component of this project, I assisted SARDI agronomist Amy Gutche with maintenance and analysis of Southern Pulse Agronomy trials and National Variety Trials. This provided valuable experience in conducting, maintaining and analysing field trials and also provided important introductions to growers in the region.

- Novel Agronomy Levers
  - Under the supervision of Dr Kenton Porker, I assisted in an agronomy project which was contracted early in 2019 within the GRDC-SARDI strategic partnership. The project “New agronomy levers for crop management; a concept study” has a component on the Eyre Peninsula. By participating in the project to assist with collecting samples to assess rooting depth at maturity for a range of treatments, I learned some valuable skills as well as contributing important data for this project.

- Snail monitoring
  - The GRDC-SARDI strategic partnership also supports snail research on the Eyre Peninsula. Under the supervision of Dr Kaye Ferguson, I assisted with data collection from video surveillance cameras recording snail activity on the EP. This was also an important training opportunity which assists with the provision of valuable data and foster interaction with growers on the Eyre Peninsula.
