My name is Enqi. I was a Chinese international student finishing the second year of Bachelor of Agricultural Science when I started this internship. I took this opportunity seriously and endeavoured to develop my personal and professional skills with the assistance of memebers in the biometry hub. At the end of this internship, the supervisors were pleased with my proformence and I was recommended to apply an Honour's degree in biometry. With a boost in confidence and the encouragement of my supervisor, I was more dedicated than ever and was able to achieve first class at the completion of my Honour's degree, which contrubuted me to become a research officer in SARDI as my first step in my professional career outside of the University. This internship has contributed me tremendously not only in study, but in life!
