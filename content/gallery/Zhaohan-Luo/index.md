My name is Zhaohan (Elijah) and I was a third-year Agricultural Science student when I completed the three week Biometry Hub Internship in July 2020. I was born and raised in Xi'an, China, and moved to Adelaide, Australia in 2014 as an international student in high school. I started my Bachelor’s degree at the University of Adelaide in 2018, immediately after high school graduation. I am very interested in agriculture because I grew up in cities and never had a real opportunity to study about the environment and nature. I believe agriculture is the future of humanity under the pressure of fast expanding world population. I am passionate about sports, especially in swimming and surfing. I am currently a member of Henley Surf Lifesaving Club and a swimming coach at Seaton Swim Centre. I am also a member of Adelaide University Boat Club.

This internship was intense but rewarding. I really enjoyed this experiecne and I have developed many computing skills through it. Here are my weekly summaries and final presentation of this internship!
