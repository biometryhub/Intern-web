My name is Alec McCallum and I was a third-year Agricultural Science student when I completed the three week Biometry Hub Internship in July 2020. I grew up in the mid-north of South Australia and the Adelaide Hills, and started my Bachelor’s degree at the University of Adelaide in 2018, after a gap year spent travelling and working. I am passionate about agriculture and am highly interested in working in Plant Science in the research field. My two main hobbies are basketball and travelling; I have played basketball since I was seven, and have travelled to over twenty countries in Europe, the Pacific and South America.
