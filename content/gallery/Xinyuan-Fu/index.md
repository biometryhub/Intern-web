My name is Xinyuan. I was in my third year of Bachelor of Agricultural Science when I started this internship with the biometry hub. I have developed a specific interest in biometry during the internship, hence why I chose to do an Honour's degreee in biometry. I was an international student when I completed my bachelor's degree. I choose this degree because I have always been passionate about agricuture. I enjoyed the world-class education provided by the University of Adelaide as it help me better understand my passion scientifically and systematically. With the addition of the internship experience with the biometry hub, I am able to progress further in my professional career!

My internship presentation is here. Have a Look!
