**Week 1**
- Introduction To R Workshop
  - You are given a workshop on intro to R and provided with a set of guided material to follow, and data examples to play with.

**You will follow the material, work on your computer, come up with solutions and discuss them with your coach.**
- Experimental Design Workshop
  - You will be also given an Experimental Design workshop and expected to manage basic designs in R after the workshop.
- Attending Statistical Meeting
  - You are invited to a professional meeting, Stats@Waite, where you can meet statisticians working at Waite and expand your network.
- Attending Seminar
  - You are invited to a seminar on ggplot2 and tidyverse.

**Week 2**
- Meeting With Senior Biometricians
  - During this week, three senior statisticians are meeting with you over coffee(s) to talk about:
      1.  Principles of statistical inference in practical applications.
      2.  Laboratory variation.
      3.  Principles of sampling designs.
      
**You will take notes and start to understand and appreciate the role of biometricians and the importance of the biometry.**
- R VS Genstat
  - Code in R of the experiment that you have designed in the Research Methodology course

**You will create a CRD/split-plot/RCBD design in R to reflect your experiment in the course.**
- Independent Reading
  - You will be reading a book named practical statistics and experimental design for plant and crop science.

**You will take some notes as you read**
  
**Week 3**
- R VS Genstat
  - You will run and analyse the experiment in R using anova or lm4 package, and present your results to the group.
- Trialling Theory In Practice
  - Another senior statistician will talk to you about the fascination of optimal design.
  
**You will continue to read the book, practice the shiny app and prepare a talk/presentation/video on the ideas of simple random sampling/accuracy of experimental measurements/randomized design of controlled experiments/use of R/etc**
