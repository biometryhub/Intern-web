The Biometry Hub group of the University of Adelaide specialises in statistical methodologies for field trials, comparative and multi-factorial experiments and field sampling in application to agriculture, horticulture, oenology and food sciences.

Our research has a strong focus on statistical genetics including linkage map construction, whole genome QTL analysis,genome wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS). We employ and develop advanced analytical computing methods in digital agriculture including big data processing, computer vision and machine learning as well as promote the adoption of cloud-based high performance computing.

We collaborate internationally and nationally and maintain a strong interest in best practice statistics in the Southern region in Australia.

The Biometry Hub starts out and supports communities of practice with solid statistical foundations through open collaborative communication with researchers and practitioners by providing tailored professional development opportunities and facilitating multi-disciplinary dialogues with user-friendly software applications.
